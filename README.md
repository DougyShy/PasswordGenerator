# My Portfolio

This project is based on a website to inform future employers of my top coding achievements. 
This project is based on informing, on the first page alone, of my front end abilities.
The end goal is to make this website viewable on multiple screen sizes and inform the viewer of experience and abilities. 

Use the KISS method.

## About

 - This portfolio website is designed mainly for desktop viewing. Although, it wouldn't take many tweeks to make it comfortable on handhelds. That is to say, the bigger the screen the better.

## Getting Started

This website should be ready for view on most devices supporting 800px width. The smaller it gets the more congested the content gets but still relatively acceptable.

## Installing

No installation necessary.

## Usage

This can be used as an example for how to start a portfolio website template. Lots of CSS is involved.
